<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi guys and old but young inside guys! 
  I'm Laura and I've been wishing a long time to be here!
  I'm trying to transform my life and follow my dreams.
  One on these is freedom. Free in creativity, free from mental cages! 
</p>

<p>I realised that my brain is similar to a computer, I can search my memories in the folders and can delete it as well as add new content.
  Our life is made up of this content.
The programmimg language are our emotions. You can choose whether to be angry, happy, loving, sad, friendly, unpleasant, ecc.
With these emotions you can realise different situations in your life. </p>

<p>Try yo program your mind to live peacefully and updating the system every day with new emotions and teachings is much more difficult than programming.
  By programming I train for this!!!
