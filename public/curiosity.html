  <li><b>The human brain is the main organ of the central nervous system that controls and coordinates all functions of the body.</b> It is responsible for perception, intelligence, emotion, memory, thought, movement, and consciousness. The brain is made up of billions of nerve cells called neurons, which communicate with each other through electrical and chemical signals to transmit information to different parts of the body. It is able to adapt and change based on experiences and stimuli from the surrounding environment, which makes it extremely versatile and important for human survival.

  </li>
  <li><b>The data storage capabilities of the human brain are still a little-known topic</b>, but there are several estimates where experts have attempted to equate human memory with digital storage. However, the human brain functions very differently from digital storage, as it is a complex organ composed of billions of interconnected neurons that rely on learning and experience to form and strengthen synaptic connections between neurons.

  </li>
  <li><b>Summary, although the storage capacities of the human brain are still poorly understood</b>, brain organoids could represent a new frontier for the development of artificial intelligence based on the human brain. However, despite technological advances, the human brain continues to draw important advantages over current artificial intelligences, such as creativity and adaptation to new contexts.</li>
